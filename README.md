# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends and make recommendations for future campaigns.  We analyzed outcomes of campaigns with a specific focus on theater and play kickstarters.  Lastly, we looked at successful and failed US-based play kickstarter in relation to campaign goals vs amount pledged.

## Results

-  Theater kickstarters in the US have more success when launched in May, June, and July.
-  Successful play kickstarters in the US were more likely successful with a goal averaging around $5K, while those that failed averaged around $10K  

## Recommendations

US theater-based kickstarters launch during the months of May, June, or July and set a reasonable goal of around $5K.
